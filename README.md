# Database Performance Comparison

* We have picked up a large dataset from Kaggle and pushed it into MySQL and MongoDB local databases using python. 
* Once databases were functional, we ran 20 queries resulting into same results on both MySQL and MongoDB.
* After execution of each query, we noted the time delays and differences between the two databases.
* Based on the findings, we prepared the results and performance report.
